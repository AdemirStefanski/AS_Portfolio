              <p className="text-base leading-6 pb-4">I am Ademir Stefanski, a front-end developer with a diverse background. I began my career as a data processing technician, gaining a solid foundation in programming logic, Oracle database queries, and development in C and C++, along with basic knowledge in Cobol.</p>
              <p className="text-base leading-6 pb-4">Beyond my initial technical experiences, I transitioned to mechanical engineering, a field that allowed me to develop my analytical and problem-solving abilities deeply. However, my passion for software development remained strong.</p>
              <p className="text-base leading-6 pb-4">Parallel to my technical career, I have also dedicated many years to photography, beginning as early as a ten-year-old. In time, I became one of the top professionals in image restoration. My work spanned creating designs for companies ranging from small businesses to large enterprises. I photographed weddings, graduations, baptisms, social events, models, and pets, and even ventured into cave photography â€” a challenging and thrilling endeavor that I thoroughly enjoyed.</p>
              <p className="text-base leading-6 pb-4">Furthermore, sports have played a significant role in my life. I played rugby for many years and practiced judo, experiences that shaped my discipline and dedication. Rugby, in particular, taught me the importance of teamwork and effective collaboration, skills I carry with me in all my professional tasks.</p>
